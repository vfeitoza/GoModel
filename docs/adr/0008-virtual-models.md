# ADR-0008: Virtual Models (unify aliases and access overrides)

## Context

GoModel exposes two operator-defined ways to shape model routing:

- **Aliases** map a new, addressable name to one real model (`fast` ->
  `openai/gpt-4o`). They are resolved early, as a rewrite.
- **Access overrides** gate an existing, scoped selector (`/`, `provider/`,
  `model`, `provider/model`) by `user_paths`. They are enforced late, as an
  authorization decision on the already-resolved model.

These are stored in separate tables, served by separate services, and surfaced
by separate admin endpoints, yet they are the same operator concept: a model
the operator defines rather than one a provider advertises. The split
duplicated `user_path` scoping and the database-migration handling, which caused
real bugs (an alias `user_paths` feature that re-implemented matching the
overrides already had, and shipped without a migration, breaking existing
databases).

We also want **load balancing** — one name resolving to several real models,
chosen per request — and there is no home for it today.

## Decision

Introduce one entity, the **virtual model**, persisted in `virtual_models` and
keyed uniquely by `source`.

- A row with `targets` is a **redirect**: `source` is a new name that rewrites
  to a real model. One target is an alias; many targets are load balancing,
  distributed by `strategy` (`round_robin`, honoring per-target `weight`, or
  `cost`). This was implemented as the additive follow-up the staging enabled —
  the `targets`, `strategy`, and `weight` columns were already persisted.
- A row without `targets` is an **access policy**: `source` is a scoped
  selector over existing models, gated by `user_paths`.

Behavior is **derived from the presence of `targets`** — there is no `role`
column. Storage, the service object, the admin API, and the dashboard are
unified, but resolution stays **staged**: redirect runs early, the access gate
runs late, exactly as before.

Pricing overrides remain a separate subsystem.

Version 1 preserves today's behavior exactly. The fields that enable load
balancing (`targets` beyond one, `strategy`, per-target `weight`) and scoped
redirects (`user_paths` on a redirect row) are stored but inert; they are
turned on by later changes that need no migration.

## Resolution Rule

1. **Resolver (early).** If the requested model exactly matches a redirect
   row's `source`, rewrite it to that row's single target.
2. **Authorizer (late).** Scope-match the resolved selector against the policy
   rows and enforce `user_paths`.

Redirect and policy rows never cross stages: a redirect `source` is a new name
that does not scope-match a real model, and a policy row has no target, so the
resolver ignores it.

## Migration

A one-time, idempotent seed copies existing `aliases` rows (as redirects) and
`model_overrides` rows (as policies) into `virtual_models` on first start when
the table is empty. The legacy tables are left intact for one release for
rollback; a later cleanup milestone removes the seed, the legacy packages, and
the legacy tables.

## Consequences

### Positive

- One `user_path` scope, one migration path, one admin surface, one UI.
- Load balancing becomes an additive change (data + a picker), not a third
  subsystem.
- Less duplicated code; the class of bug from divergent re-implementations is
  removed.

### Negative

- One table feeds two pipeline stages, mitigated by two independent in-memory
  indexes and by porting the existing, tested matching logic verbatim.
- `source` is a single namespace, so a redirect and a policy cannot share a
  name. This is structurally rare (aliases already forbid masking real models)
  and is accepted.
- Rollback is lossless only before the first virtual-model edit, because new
  writes go only to `virtual_models`.

## Update — single native engine, authoritative `Enabled`, scoped redirects, unified UI

A follow-up change completed the unification the first version staged:

- **One native engine.** The composition over the legacy `aliases` and
  `modeloverrides` services was replaced by native redirect + policy matching
  inside `virtualmodels`, operating directly on `VirtualModel` rows behind a
  single in-memory snapshot. The `internal/aliases` and `internal/modeloverrides`
  packages were removed; their tested matching logic was ported. (The legacy
  `aliases` / `model_overrides` tables remain for one release as a rollback
  net, read only by the one-time seed.)
- **`Enabled` is authoritative.** A policy row's `Enabled` now governs access: a
  disabled policy turns its selector off for everyone, an enabled policy with
  `user_paths` restricts, and a selector with no row follows
  `MODELS_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT`. This makes "disable a single model" expressible
  for the first time and lets the dashboard toggle any model on/off.
- **Scoped redirects are enforced.** `user_paths` on a redirect row are no longer
  inert: resolution consults the effective request `user_path` via the optional
  `gateway.UserPathModelResolver` (`ResolveModelForUserPath`). A redirect applies
  only for matching callers and falls through to the literal model name
  otherwise (the use case from the closed upstream PR #387). Exposure at
  `/v1/models` remains unscoped for redirects.
- **One admin surface and UI.** A single `GET/PUT/DELETE /admin/virtual-models`
  endpoint replaces `/admin/aliases` and `/admin/model-overrides`, and the
  dashboard collapses the separate alias and access-override modals into one
  virtual-model editor (Source — locked when editing an existing model — an
  always-present target field, `user_paths`, `enabled`, description) plus a
  per-row enable/disable toggle and alias-like styling for any model that carries
  a virtual model.
